# Genetic Algorithm For Circuit Boards

In the following program genetic algorithm was implemented. The problem was to find the best solution of connecting pins on circuit boards. 

### Selection
Genetic algorithm requires selection algorithm for it to work. In this case, roulette selection and tournamenst selection were implemented.

### Operators
Two operators were implemented: mutation and crossing.  
Mutation moves one selected segment in random direction.  
Crossing swaps two paths between two selected subjects.

### Genetic algorithm parameters
Parameters that are close to being optimal (producing good results) are proposed in *Main* file.  

### Examplary outputs of the algorithm
